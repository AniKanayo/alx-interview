**UTF-8 Validation**

## Description

This is a simple utility for validating whether a given byte stream is a
valid UTF-8 encoded string. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of
representing all possible characters in the Unicode standard. This tool will
help you determine if a sequence of bytes adheres to the UTF-8 encoding rules or not.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/utf8-validation).
2. Include the `utf8_validation.py` file in your project or script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use the UTF-8 validation utility, follow these steps:

```python
# Import the utf8_validation module
from utf8_validation import is_utf8_valid

# Define your byte stream
byte_stream = b'\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e'

# Check if the byte stream is a valid UTF-8 encoded string
if is_utf8_valid(byte_stream):
    print("The byte stream is a E) file for details.

else:
    print("The byte stream is NOT a valid UTF-8 encoded string.")
```

Replace `b'\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e'` with your own byte stream that you want to validate.

## How it Works

The validation process follows the UTF-8 encoding rules, which are as follows:

- Single-byte characters start with a `0` bit.
- Multi-byte characters start with a `1` bit followed by a number of `10` bits.

The `is_utf8_valid` function will examine the byte stream and verify if
it adheres to these rules. It will return `True` if the byte stream is
a valid UTF-8 encoded string; otherwise, it will return `False`.
