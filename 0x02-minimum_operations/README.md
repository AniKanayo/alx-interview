# Minimum Operations

## Introduction
The Minimum Operations module provides a method to calculate the fewest
number of operations needed to result in a specific number of 'H'
characters in a file. The operations available are Copy All and Paste.

## Installation
This module does not require any external dependencies and can be used
in any Python environment that supports the required Python version.

1. Copy the `min_operations.py` file to your project directory.
2. Import the `minOperations` method into your Python script or module.

## Usage
The `minOperations` method takes a single parameter `n`, which represents
the desired number of 'H' characters in the file. It returns the fewest
number of operations needed to achieve `n` 'H' characters.

Example usage:
```python
from min_operations import minOperations

n = 9
result = minOperations(n)
print("Number of operations:", result)
```

Output:
```
Number of operations: 6
```
