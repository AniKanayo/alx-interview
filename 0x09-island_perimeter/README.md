## Introduction

When working with geographical data represented in a grid format, such as maps, it's often
necessary to calculate the perimeter of islands within that grid. An island is typically
represented as a group of connected cells surrounded by water. Calculating the perimeter of
an island involves determining the length of the outer boundary of the islan,
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
]

perimeter = calculate_perimeter(grid)
print(f"The perimeter of the island is: {perimeter}")
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of using Island Perimeter:

1. Input Grid:
   ```
   [
       [0, 1, 0, 0],
       [1, 1, 1, 0],
       [0, 1, 0, 0],
       [1, 1, 0, 0]
   ]
   ```
   Output: The perimeter of the island is 16.

2. Input Grid:
   ```
   [
       [1, 1, 0, 0],
       [1, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 1, 1],
       [0, 1, 1, 1]
   ]
   ```
   Output: The perimeter of the island is 14.

Island Perimeter provides an algorithmic solution to calculate the perimeter of islands
within a 2D grid. It efficiently identifies the connected cells that form the island
and calculates the perimeter by counting the number of boundary edges.

## Installation

To use Island Perimeter in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/island-perimeter.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd island-perimeter`
3. Include the `island_perimeter.py` file in your project.

Island Perimeter doesn't require any external dependencies,
making it easy to integrate into your existing codebase.

## Usage

Using Island Perimeter is straightforward. Import the `calculate_perimeter`
function from the `island_perimeter` module and pass in a 2D grid representing the island.
The function will return the perimeter of the island.

```python
from island_perimeter import calculate_perimeter

grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0]
